Daily Stand-up calls/scrum
======
"A stand-up meeting (or simply "stand-up") is a meeting with attendees typically standing. The discomfort of standing for long periods helps to keep the meetings short." 

This status allows participants to know about potential challenges as well as to coordinate efforts to resolve difficult and/or time-consuming issues. 

Guidelines (see ref):

* All dev/engineering team members are required to attend scrum meetings. 
* Anyone else (for example, a departmental VP, a salesperson or a developer from another project) is allowed to attend, but is there only to listen. If you're interested in hearing where things are at, attend that day's meeting.
* This IS NOT problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues that are raised are taken offline and usually dealt with by the relevant subgroup immediately after the meeting. 
* During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:
  * What did you do yesterday?
  * What will you do today?
  * Are there any impediments in your way?

@cerdman will post standup call logs when possible. __NEEDS__ will be addressed as rapidly as possible. __ROADBLOCKS__ will be evaluated to factor into the sprint/proj dev cycle etc.
