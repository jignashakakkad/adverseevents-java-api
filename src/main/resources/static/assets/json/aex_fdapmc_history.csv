The main trial protocol (2011-003) must require a baseline resting ECG and transthoracic ECHO to assess left ventricular (LV) function on all patients. If transthoracic ECHO is not available at some sites, MUGA will be acceptable for baseline screening LVEF evaluation. For the cardiac sub-trial, a subset of patients from the main trial will be assessed for LV and right ventricular (RV) function with transthoracic ECHO (or MUGA for those sites using MUGA at baseline) periodically throughout trial treatment and at the time of the End-of-Treatment visit, using similar test procedures and equipment to allow serial intra-patient comparisons. This cardiac sub-trial must include a minimum of 100 patients and a maximum of 300 patients total (50 to 150 patients per treatment arm). Specific details regarding the interpretation of LVEF changes must be pre-specified and outlined in the SAP for this cardiac toxicity trial. For the sub-trial, readers of the ECHOs/MUGAs must be blinded to the protocol treatment given.
